# Weighting-model-ensembles
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/235575512.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/235575512)

Set of functions and a jupyter notebook, that describe a methodology to weight chemistry-climate model ensembles based upon model performance and independence.

This code supports paper submitted to ACP.

The set of functions in the python file are helper functions, based upon the python package iris, which are used to generate the weightings.
The jupyter notebook (also as a html) contains the workflow (after data preperation) for weighting chemistry-climate model initiative (CCMI) models to create a weighted prediction of Antarctic ozone depletion.
